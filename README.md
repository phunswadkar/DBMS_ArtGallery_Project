## Database Management System | Art Gallery Management System

This project intends to create an Art Gallery Management System that will track and keep details of art and paintings in an art gallery/exhibitions. The main objective of this exhibition is to promote art and artists' ideas to the public. 

The Customers who wish to buy art pieces must register prior to attending the exhibition. Customers can also participate in an auction, which will be supervised by staff and an auctioneer. The system will store data of transactions made at auction, as well as data about auction management staff.

Art and gallery management system makes it easier for gallery owners and operators to manage their daily activities.
With this software, galleries can keep track of all artwork on display and purchased by customers.
The software also maintains a list of contacts and manages important business functions such as billing and invoicing after an auction.
